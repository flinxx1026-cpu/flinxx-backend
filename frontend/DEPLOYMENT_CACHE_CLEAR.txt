DEPLOYMENT CACHE CLEAR MARKER
============================
Timestamp: 2025-12-02
Purpose: Force Vercel to clear cached builds and rebuild from scratch

This file ensures Vercel detects a new commit and rebuilds the entire application,
clearing any stale cached artifacts or JavaScript bundles.

Changes included:
- Remote video element (id="remoteVideo") is now properly included in the DOM
- UI overlay fixes to ensure video displays without background obstruction
- All WebRTC connection fixes (socket ID comparison, offer/answer/ICE routing)

Force rebuild by: Committing this file as a separate deployment marker
